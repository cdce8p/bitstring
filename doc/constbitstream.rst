ConstBitStream Class
====================

.. class:: ConstBitStream([auto, length, offset, pos, **kwargs])

    The :class:`Bits` class is the base class for :class:`ConstBitStream` and so all of its methods are also available for :class:`ConstBitStream` objects. The initialiser is the same as for :class:`Bits` except that an initial bit position :attr:`pos` can be given (defaults to 0).

    A :class:`ConstBitStream` is a :class:`Bits` with added methods and properties that allow it to be parsed as a stream of bits.

Methods
-------

bytealign
^^^^^^^^^
    .. method:: ConstBitStream.bytealign()

       Aligns to the start of the next byte (so that :attr:`pos` is a multiple of 8) and returns the number of bits skipped.

       If the current position is already byte aligned then it is unchanged. ::

            >>> s = ConstBitStream('0xabcdef')
            >>> s.pos += 3
            >>> s.bytealign()
            5
            >>> s.pos
            8

peek
^^^^
    .. method:: ConstBitStream.peek(fmt)

        Reads from the current bit position :attr:`pos` in the bitstring according to the *fmt* string or integer and returns the result.

        The bit position is unchanged.

        For information on the format string see the entry for the :meth:`read` method. ::
        
            >>> s = ConstBitStream('0x123456')
            >>> s.peek(16)
            ConstBitStream('0x1234')
            >>> s.peek('hex8')
            '12'

peeklist
^^^^^^^^
    .. method:: ConstBitStream.peeklist(fmt, **kwargs)

        Reads from current bit position :attr:`pos` in the bitstring according to the *fmt* string or iterable and returns a list of results.

        A dictionary or keyword arguments can also be provided. These will replace length identifiers in the format string. The position is not advanced to after the read items.

        See the entries for :meth:`read` and :meth:`readlist` for more information.

read
^^^^
    .. method:: ConstBitStream.read(fmt)

        Reads from current bit position :attr:`pos` in the bitstring according the format string and returns a single result. If not enough bits are available then a :exc:`ReadError` is raised.

        *fmt* is either a token string that describes how to interpret the next bits in the bitstring or an integer. If it's an integer then that number of bits will be read, and returned as a new bitstring. Otherwise the tokens are:

        ================= ===============================================================================
        ``int:n``         ``n`` bits as a signed integer.
        ``uint:n``        ``n`` bits as an unsigned integer.
        ``intbe:n``	      ``n`` bits as a byte-wise big-endian signed integer.
        ``uintbe:n``      ``n`` bits as a byte-wise big-endian unsigned integer.
        ``intle:n``       ``n`` bits as a byte-wise little-endian signed integer.
        ``uintle:n``      ``n`` bits as a byte-wise little-endian unsigned integer.
        ``intne:n``       ``n`` bits as a byte-wise native-endian signed integer.
        ``uintne:n``      ``n`` bits as a byte-wise native-endian unsigned integer.
        ``float:n``       ``n`` bits as a big-endian floating point number (same as ``floatbe``).
        ``floatbe:n``     ``n`` bits as a big-endian floating point number (same as ``float``).
        ``floatle:n``     ``n`` bits as a little-endian floating point number.
        ``floatne:n``     ``n`` bits as a native-endian floating point number.
        ``bfloat[:16]``   16 bits as a big-endian bfloat floating point number (same as ``bfloatbe``).
        ``bfloatbe[:16]`` 16 bits as a big-endian bfloat floating point number (same as ``bfloat``).
        ``bfloatle[:16]`` 16 bits as a little-endian floating point number.
        ``bfloatne[:16]`` 16 bits as a native-endian floating point number.
        ``hex:n``         ``n`` bits as a hexadecimal string.
        ``oct:n``         ``n`` bits as an octal string.
        ``bin:n``         ``n`` bits as a binary string.
        ``bits:n``        ``n`` bits as a new bitstring.
        ``bytes:n``       ``n`` bytes as a ``bytes`` object.
        ``ue``            next bits as an unsigned exponential-Golomb code.
        ``se``            next bits as a signed exponential-Golomb code.
        ``uie``           next bits as an interleaved unsigned exponential-Golomb code.
        ``sie``           next bits as an interleaved signed exponential-Golomb code.
        ``bool[:1]``      next bit as a boolean (True or False).
        ``pad:n``         next ``n`` bits will be ignored (padding).
        ================= ===============================================================================

        The ``:`` before the length is optional as of bitstring version 4, and is mostly omitted in the documentation, except where it improves readability.

        For example::

            >>> s = ConstBitStream('0x23ef55302')
            >>> s.read('hex12')
            '23e'
            >>> s.read('bin4')
            '1111'
            >>> s.read('uint5')
            10
            >>> s.read('bits4')
            ConstBitStream('0xa')

        The :meth:`~ConstBitStream.read` method is useful for reading exponential-Golomb codes. ::

            >>> s = ConstBitStream('se=-9, ue=4')
            >>> s.read('se')
            -9
            >>> s.read('ue')
            4

        The ``pad`` token is not very useful when used in :meth:`~ConstBitStream.read` as it just skips a number of bits and returns ``None``. However when used within :meth:`~ConstBitStream.readlist` or :meth:`~Bits.unpack` it allows unimportant part of the bitstring to be simply ignored.

readlist
^^^^^^^^
    .. method:: ConstBitStream.readlist(fmt, **kwargs)

        Reads from current bit position :attr:`pos` in the bitstring according to the *fmt* string or iterable and returns a list of results. If not enough bits are available then a :exc:`ReadError` is raised.

        A dictionary or keyword arguments can also be provided. These will replace length identifiers in the format string. The position is advanced to after the read items.

        See the entry for :meth:`read` for information on the format strings.

        For multiple items you can separate using commas or given multiple parameters::

            >>> s = ConstBitStream('0x43fe01ff21')
            >>> s.readlist('hex8, uint6')
            ['43', 63]
            >>> s.readlist(['bin3', 'intle16'])
            ['100', -509]
            >>> s.pos = 0
            >>> s.readlist('hex:b, uint:d', b=8, d=6)
            ['43', 63]

readto
^^^^^^
    .. method:: ConstBitStream.readto(bs, bytealigned)

        Reads up to and including the next occurrence of the bitstring *bs* and returns the results. If *bytealigned* is `True` it will look for the bitstring starting only at whole-byte positions.

        Raises a :exc:`ReadError` if *bs* is not found, and :exc:`ValueError` if *bs* is empty.

            >>> s = ConstBitStream('0x47000102034704050647')
            >>> s.readto('0x47', bytealigned=True)
            BitStream('0x47')
            >>> s.readto('0x47', bytealigned=True)
            BitStream('0x0001020347')
            >>> s.readto('0x47', bytealigned=True)
            BitStream('0x04050647')

Properties
----------

bytepos
^^^^^^^
    .. attribute:: ConstBitStream.bytepos

        Property for setting and getting the current byte position in the bitstring.
        
        When used as a getter will raise a :exc:`ByteAlignError` if the current position in not byte aligned.

pos / bitpos
^^^^^^^^^^^^
    .. attribute:: ConstBitStream.pos
    .. attribute:: ConstBitStream.bitpos

        Read and write property for setting and getting the current bit position in the bitstring. Can be set to any value from ``0`` to ``len(s)``.

        The :attr:`pos` and :attr:`bitpos` properties are exactly equivalent - you can use whichever you prefer. ::

            if s.pos < 100:
                s.pos += 10
